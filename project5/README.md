# CodeCademy Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website

# Project Goals

Building a club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen! â€‹

# Requirements

The objective is to build a webpage for a local club. I could base it on real-life organization I belong to or make one up! I would be choosing everything about the page: the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that I may use, and more!
The project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools learned so far and it should responsive by incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen.

# Inspiration

# My Take

Just like the last project, I based the page around a logo, in this case a generated logo with AI at Designer Image Creator by Microsoft of a Vespa Scooter Club. 

And in this one, instead of only using flexbox, I wanted to do something with some grid elements.

And here's the result:

Except for the logo, all images were collected from unsplash.com.

For the page I just used HTML and CSS.

# Hope you like it!
