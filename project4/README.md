# CodeCademy Challenge Project - Company Homepage with Flexbox

The objective of this project was to create a responsive webpage for a business or company using FlexBox that may include the following:

    - A title and logo or splash image.
    - A mission statement or brief description of the company.
    - A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
    - A section describing some of the companyâ€™s employees or teammates.


Codecademy provided a link of an example site as inspiration.

My approach to the challenge was to create something new instead of just following the inspirational website.

Since I was drinking an embracing warm cup of coffee at the time I was starting the project, what better use case scennario than just make a coffee shop webpage?

So I just searched for a free coffeeshop logo online and strated building a page around the logo, and here's the result.

For the page I just used HTML and CSS.
