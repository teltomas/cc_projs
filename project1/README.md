# CodeCademy Challeng Project - Build a Website Design System

# Overview

This project was slightly different than others in the start of the course, instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this one contained a series of open-ended requirements which described the project to build. There were many possible ways to correctly fulfill the requirements.


# Project Goals

In this project, the goal was to build my basic design system for a website. In essence, to build a website with guidelines to help me build MORE websites in the future! From this site, I would collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.
